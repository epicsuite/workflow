# Workflow input deck 

This is a `.yaml` file containing all information needed to complete the
end-to-end data transformation workflow. It defines input files and other
attributes used by later steps to create a 4D data ensemble that can be
read by downstream analysis and visualization tools. 

The workflow definition file defines the same input data (timesteps,
structure, tracks, etc.) for each experiment. 

Running the [workflow](workflow.md) on this file shall result in a fully populated 
4D dataset as [specified here](https://github.com/epicsuite/episcope/blob/main/spec/1.1.md)

```
